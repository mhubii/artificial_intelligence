# Artificial Intelligence

## Setting up Python 2.7
Run the Anaconda Prompt. From there run the command:

```
conda create -n iai_env python=2.7
```

This will create a new environment iai_env using python 2.7. To install packages, you need to activate the new environment using:

```
activate iai_env
```

and add packages as usual with:

```
pip install <package>
```

When using PyCharm, you now need to choose a new interpreter in settings. For setting up an additional kernel in Jupyter Notebook, follow these [instructions](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html "Link to Forum").
